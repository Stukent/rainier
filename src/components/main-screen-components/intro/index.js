        For starters, this is a styleguide for the startup called Stukent. Yet,
        as it is in an open source repository it can and is shared for the use of any.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, this styleguide contains components used throughout
        the simulations and some guidelines for
        future developers to follow and to change as styles change and programs grow.
